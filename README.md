# deformationcalculator
 calculates deformation in a cantilever beam
this software was designed by Harsh Nandwana for a research project of material selection of cantilever beam for a meber selection of drone. this was a part of python for mechanical engineering under which the values inserted were (Young's Modulus, Density and material name)
from these the output generated gives the graph of deformation of each material and at last the data for all materials entered ever is being plotted in a graph in deformation vs mass scattered point graph.
to run this you must install
```
pip install numpy
```
now install matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```
and install anastruct
```
pip install anastruct
```
publishing data from this deformationcalculator without knowledge of owner is prohibited.
